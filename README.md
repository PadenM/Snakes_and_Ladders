# Snakes_and_Ladders
Instructions for demo:
1. Download the Snakes_and_Ladders_demo.exe and mazes.zip that contains the maze config files.
2. Unzip the config files and place them in the same directory as the demo.
3. The game looks for "Maze.txt" so rename the maze config text file of your choice to this.
